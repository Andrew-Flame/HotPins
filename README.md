### Description
'Hot Pins' is a mod for Valheim that adds ways to quickly add markers to the game map.
Have you ever found ore deposits or dungeons while running away from enemies?
What were you doing at that moment?
Maybe you tried to set a pin on the map, risking death, asked your friend to mark this place or just did nothing.
Especially for such cases, I have developed this modification.
Now you can create pins on the game map completely safely in the blink of an eye.
All you need after installing my mod is to use standard keys and keyboard shortcuts (or customize your own) to create pins.
